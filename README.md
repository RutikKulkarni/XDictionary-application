# XDictionary-application

XDictionary is a simple React-based dictionary application that allows users to search for word definitions in a predefined dictionary.

## Features

- Case-insensitive search functionality.
- Inform users when a word is not found in the dictionary.

## Usage

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Enter a word in the search bar, for example, "React", and click the "Search" button. The application will display the definition for the entered word.
