# XDictionary-application

XDictionary is a simple React-based dictionary application that allows users to search for word definitions in a predefined dictionary.

## Features

- Search for word definitions in a predefined dictionary.
- Case-insensitive search functionality.
- Inform users when a word is not found in the dictionary.

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. You will see the XDictionary application with a search bar and a "Search" button. The initial render will display an empty search bar.

4. Enter a word in the search bar, for example, "React", and click the "Search" button. The application will display the definition for the entered word.

5. The search is case-insensitive. For example, searching for "component" will yield the same result as searching for "Component".

6. If the entered word is not found in the dictionary, the application will display the message "Word not found in the dictionary."

7. Explore the application's user interface and functionality. Test different words and observe the displayed definitions.
